# Scalable Realtime Chat Application Using Redis!

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app
server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
